Dataset Abstract

	Marsh plant species percent cover for Rowley River tidal creeks associated with long term fertilization experiments, Rowley and Ipswich, MA. The TIDE project aims to simulate eutrophication on a large scale by the addition of NO3- aiming to reach 70ÂµM concentrations from May to September every year during the growing season. This fertilization of the marsh has been going on at Sweeney Creek since the 2004 growing season through 2011 and at Clubhead Creek in 2005 and from 2009 till 2011.

Methods



	Method Step 

		Description 

			
            
Percent Cover was taken for a variety of species for 1m2  quadrats along a ~50 meter transect.  1m2  quadrats  were placed at every single meter mark and percent cover was determined by several individuals of all species present.  If < 1 % then species was said to be "present", during the entering of data present species were give  a  0.01 % value except for TSA which was give 0.1%.  These transects were sampled  every year between 2003-2009 and in 2011.    Mean values per quadrat were derieved for average transect % cover.

Abbreviations:
TSA- Spartina alterniflora (tall form)
SSA- Spartina alterniflora (short form)
DS- Distichlis spicata
SP- Spartina patens
JG- Juncus gerardii
TM- Triglochin maritima
AP- Atroplex patula
SD- Salicornia depressa
LC- Limonium carolinianum
IF- Iva frutescens
Water- Water in quadrat
Mud- Mud in quadrat
Dead- Dead in quadrat

Creeks-
Reference creeks are West (WE) and Nelson(NE)
Nutrient Enriched creeks are Sweeney (SW) and Clubhead(CL).  Sweeney has been fertilized every summer from  2004-2011.  Clubhead had been fertilized in  2005 and then from 2009-2011.

All creeks have two branches determined by direction at confluence while facing upstream (Left or Right).   

Plant transects run perpendicular to  creeks at various points with a front pole at the creek bank and a back pole an the high marsh. Transects are in the order of 1, 2, 4, 3 or blue, green, red, yellow from confluence of branch.
