## Plum Island LTER

PIE LTER is a long term ecological research network involving  PIs and students from a range of Universities. Their mission is to understand marsh ecosystems, the land-sea interface, and involve government and non-government organizations in outreach & understanding current or future anthropogenic impact on these environments.

My interests were directed towards thoughts about marsh diversity in the **Tide Project**.

## The Tide Project

- *A unique approach* at scaling experimental ecology and studying **true** effects (mesocosm).
  - The entire ecosystem, inclusive of known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns is present and active.
- *Addressing issues of global-change biology* by studying abiotic and geochemical shifts on a larger scale.
  - Effects on the nitrogen, carbon, or sulfur cycles are more accurately understood.
- *An emphasis on undergraduate and young scientist involvement* to bring in more young investigators.
  - Easy to approach front of ideas with hands on experiential gains to be had.

## Data of interest

- Two datasets pertaining to the Clubhead, Sweeney, Nelson, and West creeks; the first two being fertilized sites recieving nitrogen rich runoff, and the latter two being control sites.
- One of these datasets describes acroinfaunal counts of species in the creeks, and the other describes nekton counts in the creeks; their common factors to join by being month, year, creek, and branch of the creek.
- This involved some pretty in depth usage of **tidyr**, **dplyr**, **readr**, **janitor**, **lubridate**, and **vegan**.
  - The data was really good but months were and years were recorded with different systems that were not datetime compliant and had to be extracted and modified to join on.
  - Counts for nekton was wide data instead of long data and had to be summarized from grids to a branch, cleaned, and then pivoted to long data.
