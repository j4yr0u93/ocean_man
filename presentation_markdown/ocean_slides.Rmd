## Plum Island LTER

PIE LTER is a long term ecological research network involving  PIs and students from a range of Universities. Their mission is to understand marsh ecosystems, the land-sea interface, and involve government and non-government organizations in outreach & understanding current or future anthropogenic impact on these environments.

My interests were directed towards thoughts about marsh diversity in the **Tide Project**.

## The Tide Project

- *A unique approach* at scaling experimental ecology and studying **true** effects (mesocosm).
  - The entire ecosystem, inclusive of known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns is present and active.
- *Addressing issues of global-change biology* by studying abiotic and geochemical shifts on a larger scale.
  - Effects on the nitrogen, carbon, or sulfur cycles are more accurately understood.
- *An emphasis on undergraduate and young scientist involvement* to bring in more young investigators.
  - Easy to approach front of ideas with hands on experiential gains to be had.

## Data of interest

- Two datasets pertaining to the Clubhead, Sweeney, Nelson, and West creeks; the first two being fertilized sites recieving nitrogen rich runoff, and the latter two being control sites.
- One of these datasets describes acroinfaunal counts of species in the creeks, and the other describes nekton counts in the creeks; their common factors to join by being month, year, creek, and branch of the creek.
- This involved some pretty in depth usage of **tidyr**, **dplyr**, **readr**, **janitor**, **lubridate**, and **vegan**.
  - The data was really good but months were and years were recorded with different systems that were not datetime compliant and had to be extracted and modified to join on.
  - Counts for nekton was wide data instead of long data and had to be summarized from grids to a branch, cleaned, and then pivoted to long data.

## Spaghetti Code

## Preliminary Visualization
```{r vis1, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nektonxmacro %>% filter(month == 8) %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y =  shannon, color = creek)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(type~treatment) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

## What is up in the Nekton Club
```{r vis2, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nektonxmacro %>% filter(creek == 'Clubhead', type == 'nekton', month == 8, branch == 'Right') %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Inspecting Nekton & Macro Club
```{r vis3, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nektonxmacro %>% filter(creek == 'Clubhead', month == 8, species %in% c('palaemonetes_pugio', 'fundulus_heteroclitus', 'streblospio_benedicti', 'manayunkia_aestuarina', 'menidia_menidia'), branch == 'Right') %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  stat_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

## Inspecting Nekton & Macro Sweeney
```{r vis4, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nektonxmacro %>% filter(creek == 'Sweeney', month == 8, species %in% c('palaemonetes_pugio', 'fundulus_heteroclitus', 'streblospio_benedicti', 'manayunkia_aestuarina', 'menidia_menidia'), branch == 'Right') %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  stat_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

## Nekton & Macro effects
```{r vis5, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
creek_effect <- glm(total_count ~ date + creek * type, data = nektonxmacro)
contrast(emmeans(creek_effect, ~ creek | type))
```

- Fertilized creeks are clearly outliers from very similar controls
- Nekton effect is not obvious in data, look at species

## Nekton & Macro assumption
```{r vis6, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(creek_effect, which = c(1, 2, 4))
```

Resids, qqplot, and cooks d are all in normal assumption range.

## Nekton Species Effect
```{r vis7, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nekton_subset <- nektonxmacro %>% filter(type == 'nekton', species %in% c('anguilla_rostrata', 'crangon_septemspinosa', 'fundulus_heteroclitus', 'menidia_menidia', 'palaemonetes_pugio', 'pungitius_pungitius', 'xanthidae_spp'))
key_nekton_effect <- glm(count ~ date + creek * species, data = nekton_subset, family = 'Gamma')
nek.emm <- emmeans(key_nekton_effect, ~ creek | species)
contrast(regrid(nek.emm))
```

## Nekton Species assumption
```{r vis8, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(key_nekton_effect, which = c(1, 2, 4))
```

## Bad data?
```{r vis9, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
descdist(nekton_subset$count)
```


## Shannon Model
```{r vis10, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
creek_effect <- glm(shannon ~ date + creek * type, data = nektonxmacro)
contrast(emmeans(creek_effect, ~ creek | type))
```
